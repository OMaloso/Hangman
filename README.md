# Hangman in C++

A simple hangman game built in C++.

I put this together piecemeal over a couple of days to continue learning C++. It started off as a small project just for the game, but I 
also got carried away with file loading that allows for editing of the word list and loading custom word lists.

## Future Additions

A few additions that I would consider adding in the future:
* Seperating lowercase/uppercase. At the moment program considers these to be seperate entities.
* Allowing for spaces, so that small sentences could be used, not just singular words
* Allowing for additional character types, specifically for diacritical marks used in other languages.
